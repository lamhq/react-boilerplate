We'll use Vite because create-react-app:

- becomes slow when the application grows
- takes a lot of time to refresh the page when we make any changes in the application code.
- it also adds a lot of extra packages which we rarely need.

Vite has the fast refresh, greatly improved development experience. faster alternative to create-react-app.
