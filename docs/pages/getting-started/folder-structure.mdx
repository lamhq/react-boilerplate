# Folder Structure

Your project should look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".github"/>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".vscode"/>
  <FileTree.Folder name="cypress"/>
  <FileTree.Folder name="docs"/>
  <FileTree.Folder name="node_modules"/>

## Root directory

This project is built using Vite, therefore the root directory
is not significantly different from a typical Vite project.
The crucial files and directories are as follows:

- `index.html`: the main HTML file that serves as the
[entry point](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root) for your application.
- `vite.config.ts`: the [configuration file](https://vitejs.dev/config/#configuring-vite)
for the Vite project.
- `.github/`: contains configuration files for GitHub Workflow and a pull request template for this project.
- `.vscode/`: contains VS Code's settings and launch configurations for running and debugging the project.
- `cypress/`: contains end-to-end test files using the Cypress framework.
- `docs/`: contains the source code for the project's documentation website.
- `src/`: contains the project's source code and configuration.


## `src` directory

This is where you put your code files to implement features and fix bugs.

Important files:
- `config.ts`: contains the application's configuration.
It defines parameters and values that you can use in your code through the config API.
- `main.tsx`: this file serves as the entry point for the application.
It contains the main code for setting up and rendering the React root component.
- `router`: this is where all pages and their routes are defined.
- `theme.ts`: contains the configuration of the current theme.


## Module directory

The top directories in the `src` directory are divided into **modules**.
These modules are self-contained pieces of code that perform specific functions
or provide a certain set of features. The existing modules are:

- `common`: provides frequently used APIs, utility functions, and type definitions
for almost all React projects. Anything that can be reused between projects
(not related to business-specific code) will be placed here.
- `configuration`: contains code and utilities for working with the application's configuration.
- `di`: provides APIs for the Dependency Injection feature.
It allows injecting service class instances into React components
and automates initialization of the services' dependencies.
- `error-handler`: provides a pattern for handling errors in React applications
in a centralized place. It can catch and handle errors in React render code
as well as event handlers or callback functions.
- `demo`: contains example code that demonstrates common web development techniques
such as lazy loading, authentication, data fetching, data mutation, pagination, and more.


The following text has been corrected:

The code inside a module is organized into different categories based on type:

- `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`, `templates/`, `pages/`: These are categories of components
that follow the [Atomic Design methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
- `hocs/`: contains the code for higher-order components.
- `hooks/`: contains React hook code.
- `contexts/`: contains the code for declaring React contexts.
- `types/`: contains Typescript interface or type definition code.
- `utils/`: contains utility functions that are used throughout the project.
- Feel free to add your own category if it's not in the list above...

Though it's not required, there may be an `index.ts` file in the module's root diretory.
This file export code of the current module for outside use.
It provides a cleaner and simpler way for external modules or files
to import and use the functionality within that module.
