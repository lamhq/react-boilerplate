### General

#### Default branch

Set to *your main branch*.

#### Pull Requests

Uncheck **Allow merge commits**.

<Callout type="info">
Merge commits typically contain a larger and more complex set of changes,
reviewing these changes may be less straightforward.
</Callout>

Check **Allow squash merging**, **Default to pull request title and description**
<Callout type="info">
Use squash merging to have a lean commit history.
</Callout>

Uncheck **Allow rebase merging**.
<Callout type="info">
Rebase merging can introduce complex merge conflicts, especially when
 multiple developers are working on the same branch or when there have been
  many changes since the branch was created. By disallowing rebase merging,
  it simplifies the merging process for users who might be
  less experienced with resolving these conflicts.
</Callout>

Check **Allow auto-merge** (optional).

Check **Automatically delete head branches**.


### Branches

#### Branch protection rules

Add a rule with following settings:

- **Branch name pattern**: set to *your main branch*
- Check **Require a pull request before merging**
  - Check **Require approvals**
  - Check **Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed**
- Check **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - Check **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
  - Search for status checks: **Lint** and **Unit test** from the search box
- Check **Require linear history**.

<Callout type="info">
Linear and lean history help reviewing changes easily, especially when finding issues related to code changes.
</Callout>


### Environments

Create 3 environments:

- `dev`: for development team to test
- `staging`: for QA team to test before releasing
- `production`: for customers to use

#### `production`

- Check **Required reviewers**. Add people to review when deploying to this environment.
- In **Deployment branches**. Change to **Selected Branches**. Add deployment branch rule: `v?.?.?` (only release tags can be deployed to this environment)


#### `dev` and `staging`

Configure as you want. It may not need to be strict as `production`.


### Secrets and variables

#### Actions (Actions secrets and variables)

##### Create a Github Token for deployment

You can skip this step if you don't want to use the [release strategy](release-and-deploy.md) defined in this codebase.

First, create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with scopes: `repo` and `workflow`.

![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-139735/mw-1000/images/help/settings/userbar-account-settings.webp)

Copy the token. Then, create a **repository secret** named `RELEASE_TOKEN` with the value is the personal access token created above.
