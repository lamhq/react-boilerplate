# Getting Started

## Overview

This is a starter codebase for a single-page web application using React and Typescript.

## Why Another React Boilerplate?

### The Problems

There are so many React Boilerplates out there that provide great support and more features than this project, but they often:

- Provide a lot of features and add dependencies that you don't need. You must either check each dependency to know if you need it or come with a lot of unused dependencies that slow down the installation process.
- Lack customization options by abstracting many things. When it comes to customization, digging in reveals a lot of complexity that is difficult to understand.
- Have a long learning curve and extensive documentation.


### Goals

This project aims to:

1. Maximize the development experience.
2. Provide solutions for solving common problems in React web applications (routing, authentication, error handling, data fetching, ...) .
3. Minimize the learning curve and introduce new concepts.
4. Be flexible and adaptable to change.
5. Act as a code snippet repository for developers. You can copy the code files of the feature you need to your project without using this boilerplate.

# Notes

- utilizing existing features provided by the underlying frameworks/libraries
- no introducing new concepts, commands
- having a lean documentation

while try to avoid adding complexity as much as possible.
