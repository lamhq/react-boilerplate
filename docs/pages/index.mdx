## Why another React Boilerplate?

There are so many React Boilerplates out there that provide
great support and more features than this project, but they often:

- Provide a lot of features and add dependencies that you don't need.
You must either check each dependency to know if you need it
or end up with a lot of unused dependencies that slow down
the installation process.
- Lack customization options by abstracting many things.
When it comes to customization, digging in reveals a lot of
complexity that is difficult to understand.
- Have a long learning curve and extensive documentation.

This project aims to be lightweight, easy to customize and
understand. It strives to provide a great development experience
and assists developers in quickly jumping in and starting work
without worrying about standards, workflow processes, or principles.


## Features

- Built on top of **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**, which offers faster build times,
a development server with extremely fast Hot Module Replacement,
and many other great [benefits](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html).
- **TypeScript** ready.
- Configured **path alias** for clean import path.
- **Well-organized** folder structure.
- Supports **dependency injection** that brings easy testing with mocking,
loose coupling, flexibility, and reusability.
- Contains a lightweight and reusable **data fetching** pattern with React Suspense.
- Include configuration for **linter** (ESLint) and React TypeScript code style guidelines.
- Provides an **IDE** (VS Code) configuration for convenient application execution and debugging.
- Incorporates **unit test** runner (Jest) and **end-to-end test** framework (cypress).
- Includes **example code** for common web development techniques such as
lazy loading, authentication, data fetching, data mutation, pagination,
unit testing, and end-to-end testing.
- Provides an **automated check** for commit message and branch name on commit.
- Includes a **CI/CD** setup using GitHub Actions. It automates the process of
running unit tests, end-to-end tests, and linter checks on pull requests.
- Manage software releases with **semantic versioning**, including auto-generated version numbers and changelogs.
- **Deploy** to runtime environments by approving in GitHub UI.
- Lean **development workflow** and **branching strategy** for agile development (base on trunk-based development).
