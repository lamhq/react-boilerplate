# Getting Started

## Overview

This is a starter codebase for a single-page web application using React and Typescript.

## Why another React Boilerplate?

### The Problems

There're so many React Boilerplate out there that provide great support and more features than this project, but they often:

- Provide a lot of features and add dependencies that you don't need. You must either study those dependencies (to know if you need them) or come with a lot of unused depencies that slowdown the installation process.
- Lack of customization options by abstracting many things. When it comes to customization, digging in reveal a lot of complexity that difficult to understand.
- Long learning curve, long documentation.

### Goals

This project aims to:

1. Provide solutions for solving common problems of React web application.
2. Minimize the learning curve and new concepts.
3. Maximize the development experience.
4. Be flexible to change and adapted.
5. Act as a code snippet repository for developers. You can copy the code files of the feature you need to your project without using this boilerplate.

### Solutions


## Features

## Start a New Project

## Available Scripts

## Folder structure


# Notes

- utilizing existing features provided by the underlying frameworks/libraries
- no introducing new concepts, commands
- having a lean documentation

(like authentication, error handling, data fetching) while try to avoid adding complexity as much as possible.
