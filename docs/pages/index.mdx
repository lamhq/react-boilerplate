# Getting Started

## Overview

This is a starter codebase for a single-page web application using React and Typescript.

## Why another React Boilerplate?

### The Problems

There're so many React Boilerplate out there that provide great support and useful features than this project, but they:

- Provide a lot of features and use libraries that you don't need. You must either research the purpose of those library (to know if they're safe to remove) or leave a lot of unused depencies slowdown the installation process.
- Lack of customization options by abstracting almost everything. When it comes to customization, digging in reveal a lot of complexity that difficult to understand.
