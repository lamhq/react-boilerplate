## Overview

This is a starter repository that provides the essential components for React Single Page Application projects.

This project is made simple and include only what is needed for most projects, such as:

- A pre-configured linter for code style checking
- IDE settings for running and debugging the application
- Documentation for development workflow and branching strategy
- CI/CD setup for running unit tests, releases, and deployments
- Pre-defined code for common tasks like routing, form handling, global state management, i18n, ...
- ...

Additionally, there are demos and examples that illustrate different techniques in web development
(image lazy loading, data mutation, pagination, and unlimited scrolling, ...).

Each demo is self-contained in a single code file, lightweight, and easy to understand.
